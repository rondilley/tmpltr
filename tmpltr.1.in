.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Log Templater(\fltmpltr\fP) is a high-performance log processor that provides advanced artificial ignorance capabilities with intelligent field type detection.  The tool automatically identifies and templates various field types including integers, floats, hexadecimal values, MAC addresses, IPv4/IPv6 addresses, BASE64 encoded data, syslog dates, and ISO timestamps.  You use the tool to process past log data and store templates that represent normal log line structures.  You then run the tool against current or target logs and all normal patterns are automatically ignored, leaving only anomalous entries for analysis.

.SH OPTIONS
Command line options are described below.
.TP 5
.B \-c
Enable clustering mode to display template output showing invariant (non-variable) fields alongside variable field templates.  This mode preserves constant portions of log messages while templating variable data.
.TP
.B \-d
Enable debug mode, the higher the \fllog\-level\fP, the more verbose the logging.
.TP
.B \-g
Ignore double quotes and use greedy tokenization.  This option treats quoted strings as regular tokens rather than preserving them as literal strings.
.TP
.B \-h
Display help details.
.TP
.B \-t
Load templates from a file.  Log lines matching these pre-existing templates will be ignored during processing, effectively filtering out known patterns.
.TP
.B \-v
Show version information.
.TP
.B \-w
Save all discovered templates to a file for later use with the -t option or for analysis of log patterns.
.TP
.B filename
One or more files to process, use '\-' to read from stdin.  Multiple files can be specified for batch processing.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Process a log file using standard templating mode.
.B tmpltr
.I file
.PP
.TP
Process a log file using clustering mode to show invariant fields.

\-c
.I file
.PP
.TP
Process file and save all unique templates to outfile.
.B tmpltr
\-w 
.I outfile
.I file
.PP
.TP
Read templates from infile and process file, ignoring templates found in infile.
.B tmpltr
\-t
.I infile
.I file
.PP
.TP
Read templates from infile and process file, ignoring templates found in infile and writing all templates from infile plus newly discovered ones to outfile.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.B \fltmpltr\fP 
returns 0 on normal program termination and 1 on error.  Additional diagnostic information is available through the \-d command line switch.

.SH SIGNALS
.TP
SIGHUP will cause \fltmpltr\fP to quit gracefully.
.TP
SIGTERM will cause \fltmpltr\fP to shutdown.
